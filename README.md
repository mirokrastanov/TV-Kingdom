# Technical Information

## Front End side 
### This SPA project was built using the Angular framework
- More information regarding Angular can be found in [this README](https://github.com/mirokrastanov/NBA-Dashboard/blob/main/client/README.md) and in the [Angular Docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/api).


## Back End side
### Back End is fully handled by Firebase
- Read the details of this project's back end handling and challenges. [Here](https://github.com/mirokrastanov/NBA-Dashboard/blob/main/server/README.md)

### NBA Data obtained via web scraping
- The lack of a free and feasible good API led to me learning web scraping and incorporating it for this project.
- It was a great way for me to learn more about the `puppeteer` library and web scraping as a whole.
- This of course made the Front End use of this data harder than using a regular API. 
- There were many challenges and the process was very involved. 
- Read more about it [Here](https://github.com/mirokrastanov/NBA-Dashboard/tree/main/web-scrapers)
